- **Draggable Widgets**: Move widgets around the grid using drag-and-drop.
- **Multi-Cell Widgets**: Widgets can span multiple columns and rows (e.g., 2x1, 2x2, etc.).
- **Widget Swapping**: Swap positions with another widget if both have the same size.
- **No Overlap**: Widgets cannot overlap, except for valid swaps.
- **Visual Feedback**: Grid cells highlight when a widget can be dropped there. Only valid drop areas are highlighted.

- **Responsive and Accessible**: Works on all modern browsers.
